"Why do some people develop chronic pain?":

  description:
    + We are searching for key molecular events that define long-lasting pain. For instance, looking at transcriptional events that remain persistent from the acute to the chronic phase of pain.

    + We are also developing new models to mimic genetic/environmental variability to reproduce differential susceptibility to chronic pain in laboratory animals.

    + We want to understand if differences in cellular or organismal lipid metabolism are the key to this differential susceptibility.


"How do lipids and lipid metabolism affect Pain?":

  description:

    + We want to understand how dysregulated lipid metabolism and accumulation in microglia affect microglial phenotype and immune function.

    +  We want to know if lipid or lipid metabolites serve as key molecules bridging signaling or neuron-glia communication.

    +  We want to understand how lipids influence epigenetic and reprogramming events in glia and macrophages.



"Understanding Migraine pathophysiology":

  description:
      + Understand the role of AIBP (which coding gene was found to be a susceptibility loci) in migraine pathophysiology.

      + Identify the role of lipid dysregulation in macrophages in trigeminal neuron excitability, priming, and sensitization in migraine.

      + Develop new animal models of migraine that reflect differential susceptibility.
