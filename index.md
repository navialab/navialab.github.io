Welcome to the Navia lab! Our group's research seeks to understand how lipid
metabolism affects pain states and chronic pain susceptibility.
Our group will investigate immuno-metabolic changes and transcriptional regulation underlying chronic pain development.
We are building a team of curious scientists to explore neuro-immune interactions, cellular reprogramming, and metabolic mechanisms across various cell types involved in nociceptive pathways in different animal models of chronic pain.
The lab aims to uncover new mechanisms and pathways and potential therapeutic targets for safe treatments of chronic pain.
